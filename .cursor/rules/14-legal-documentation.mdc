## 7. Common Legal Writing Mistakes

### 7.1 Ambiguity Examples

**❌ BAD: Payment Terms**
```markdown
"The consultant will be paid a reasonable fee for their work in a timely manner."
```
*Why it's bad:* "Reasonable fee" and "timely manner" are subjective and undefined.

**✅ GOOD: Payment Terms**
```markdown
"Client shall pay Consultant a fixed fee of $2,500.00. Payment shall be made in full via wire transfer within fifteen (15) days of the Client's receipt of the final deliverable."
```

**❌ BAD: Confidentiality**
```markdown
"Both parties agree to keep things confidential."
```
*Why it's bad:* Vague about what is confidential, for how long, and with what exceptions.

**✅ GOOD: Confidentiality**
```markdown
**Confidential Information** shall mean any and all non-public technical and business information disclosed by one party to the other, including but not limited to trade secrets, financial information, and client lists.

The receiving party shall not disclose the Confidential Information for a period of three (3) years from the Effective Date.
```

### 7.2 Structure Mistakes

**❌ BAD: Wall of Text**
```markdown
Users agree that by using our service they will not violate any laws or regulations and will not upload harmful content or abuse other users and understand that we may terminate their access if they violate these terms and that they are responsible for their own content and actions.
```

**✅ GOOD: Clear Structure**
```markdown
## User Obligations

1. Comply with all applicable laws and regulations
2. Refrain from uploading harmful or inappropriate content
3. Respect other users and maintain civil discourse
