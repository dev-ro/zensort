# Workflow: Test-Driven Development (TDD)

When I ask you to create a new feature or add new logic, you MUST follow this Test-Driven Development workflow.

1. **Clarify Requirements:** First, briefly state your understanding of the feature and its requirements.
2. **Write the Test First:** Before writing any implementation code, create a new test file (e.g., `feature_name_test.dart`). Write one or more tests that describe the desired functionality. These tests should naturally fail at first.
3. **Run the Test:** State that you would now run the test and expect it to fail.
4. **Write Implementation Code:** Write the minimum amount of implementation code necessary to make the failing test pass.
5. **Run Tests Again:** State that you would run the tests again to confirm they now pass.
6. **Refactor:** Once the tests are passing, refactor the implementation code for clarity and efficiency, ensuring the tests continue to pass.

**Example:** For a new feature, you will first create `test/my_feature_test.dart`, then `lib/my_feature.dart`.
