# ZenSort Theme & Reusability

To maintain a consistent, clean, and calming design, all UI components MUST use the centralized theme defined in `lib/theme.dart`. Do not use hardcoded colors, gradients, or text styles.

## Gradients

- **Primary Gradient:** For all primary call-to-action buttons and highlighted borders, you MUST use `ZenSortTheme.primaryGradient`. Do not recreate this `LinearGradient` manually.
- **App Bar Gradient:** The `AnimatedGradientAppBar` uses `ZenSortTheme.appBarGradient`. Reuse this widget instead of creating new animated app bars.

## Colors & Text

- Use `Theme.of(context)` to access colors and text styles (e.g., `Theme.of(context).textTheme.headlineMedium`).
- For specific, non-standard colors, use the constants defined in `ZenSortTheme` (e.g., `ZenSortTheme.purple`).

## Reusable Widgets

- When asked to create a new UI element, first check if a similar component already exists in `lib/widgets/`.
- Prioritize abstracting new UI into reusable widgets rather than creating one-off implementations. For example, the `_FeatureItem` and `_BuildStep` widgets in `main.dart` are good examples of reusable components that should be moved to their own files in `lib/widgets/`.
