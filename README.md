> Find clarity in the chaos.

ZenSort is a digital organization tool designed to bring peace and order to your digital life. It starts by helping you organize your YouTube liked videos into "Smart Shelves," making it easy to rediscover the content you love.

## ✨ Features

- **Rediscover Your Library**: Effortlessly organize your entire liked video library.
- **AI-Powered "Smart Shelves"**: Our AI uses k-means clustering to automatically group your videos into intelligent, well-defined shelves.
- **Export to Playlists**: Turn your Shelves into new YouTube playlists to escape the algorithm.
- **Find Lost Music**: Locate and restore your legacy music uploads.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
- [Firebase CLI](https://firebase.google.com/docs/cli)
- An editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio).

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/dev-ro/zensort.git
    cd zensort
    ```

2. **Install Flutter dependencies:**

    ```sh
    flutter pub get
    ```

3. **Set up Firebase:**
    - This project uses different Firebase configurations for development and production.
    - Place your `google-services.json` (for Android) and `GoogleService-Info.plist` (for iOS) in the respective platform directories.
    - The app uses two different Firebase projects: one for development (`zensort-dev`) and one for production (`zensort-prod`). The correct configuration is chosen at build time.

### Running the App

The application uses a flavor system to separate development and production environments.

- **To run in development mode:**

    ```sh
    flutter run --dart-define=FLAVOR=dev
    ```

    This will use the `firebase_options_dev.dart` configuration.

- **To run in production mode:**

    ```sh
    flutter run --dart-define=FLAVOR=prod
    ```

    This will use the `firebase_options.dart` configuration.
