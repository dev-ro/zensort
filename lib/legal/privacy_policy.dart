**1. Information We Collect**

We may collect information about you in a variety of ways. The information we may collect via the Service includes:

**a) Personal Data**
When you register for an account using Google Sign-In, we collect the following personally identifiable information from your Google profile:
- **Name and Email Address:** Your name and email address are used for account identification and communication.

**b) Authentication Data**
To connect your YouTube account, we use Firebase Authentication with Google Sign-In. We receive and store authentication tokens from Google, which are necessary to securely access the YouTube API on your behalf. We do not have access to, nor do we store, your Google account password.

**c) YouTube Data**
When you connect your YouTube account, we access certain data from the YouTube API service. This includes:
- **Metadata of your "liked" videos:** such as titles, descriptions, and thumbnails.
We do not download or store the video files themselves. Our use of this data is for the sole purpose of providing the ZenSort features, such as creating "Shelves" and "Smart Shelves".

ZenSort's use and transfer of information received from Google APIs will adhere to the [Google API Services User Data Policy](https://developers.google.com/terms/api-services-user-data-policy), including the Limited Use requirements.

You can revoke ZenSort's access to your YouTube data at any time via the [Google security settings page](https://security.google.com/settings/security/permissions).

**d) User-Generated Content**
We collect the information you provide when you create and organize your "Shelves." This includes the names of your shelves and the videos you assign to them.

**e) Usage Data and Cookies**
We may automatically collect information about your device and how you interact with our Service, such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, and usage patterns. We use cookies and similar tracking technologies to track activity on our Service and hold certain information.

**2. How We Use Your Information**

We use the information we collect to:
