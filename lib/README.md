# Application Source Code (`lib`)

This directory is the heart of the ZenSort Flutter application. It contains all the Dart code that defines the user interface, application logic, and core functionality.

## File & Directory Structure

- `main.dart`: This is the main entry point of the application. It initializes Firebase, sets up the application's theme, and defines the root widget (`MyApp`). The `LandingPage` and all its sub-components are defined here.

- `theme.dart`: This file (if it existed, or as a concept) would define the application's visual theme, including colors, fonts, and other styling attributes to ensure a consistent look and feel. *(Note: Currently, theme data is within `main.dart` but could be refactored here).*

- `firebase_options.dart`: Contains the Firebase configuration for the **production** environment. This file is generated by the FlutterFire CLI.

- `firebase_options_dev.dart`: Contains the Firebase configuration for the **development** environment. This allows for safe testing and development without affecting production data.

- `legal/`: This directory holds the legal documents for the application.
  - `privacy_policy.dart`: A string constant containing the application's privacy policy.
  - `terms_of_service.dart`: A string constant containing the application's terms of service.

## Key Widgets

The `main.dart` file is composed of several key widgets that form the landing page:

- **`MyApp`**: The root widget of the application, which sets up `MaterialApp`.
- **`LandingPage`**: The main page view, which is a `ListView` of the different sections.
- **`HeroSection`**: The top section of the landing page, introducing ZenSort.
- **`FeaturesSection`**: Highlights the key features of the application.
- **`HowItWorksSection`**: Explains the steps for using the app.
- **`CallToActionSection`**: A section with a form to join the waitlist.
- **`Footer`**: The footer of the page with legal links and copyright information.

## Flavors (Build Environments)

The application uses a flavor system to switch between `dev` and `prod` environments. This is controlled by the `--dart-define=FLAVOR=<name>` flag when running the app.

- **Development (`dev`)**: Uses `firebase_options_dev.dart`.
- **Production (`prod`)**: Uses `firebase_options.dart`.

This setup ensures that development and testing are isolated from the production environment.
