# For cost control, you can set the maximum number of containers that can be
# running at the same time. This helps mitigate the impact of unexpected
# traffic spikes by instead downgrading performance. This limit is a per-function
# limit. You can override the limit for each function using the max_instances
# parameter in the decorator, e.g. @https_fn.on_request(max_instances=5).
